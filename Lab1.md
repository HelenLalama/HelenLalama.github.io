# Methods in C#

## Define a Method
To make a new method, we need to understand where and how to make a method. 
```
void CountToTen()
{
 for (int current = 1; current <= 10; current++)
 Console.WriteLine(current);
}
```
The first thing you do is to determine the return type of your method. In this case is *void*.
Next you decide the name of the method. On the example you we used the name *CountToTen*.
Finally inside the parenthesis you put the parameter. Since the metod is of the type void, it remains empty.

## Important things of methods

* Methods Get Their Own Variables.
* You can pass data into a method.
* A method can have as many parameters as necessary.
* Return values allow the method to send data back to the calling method.
